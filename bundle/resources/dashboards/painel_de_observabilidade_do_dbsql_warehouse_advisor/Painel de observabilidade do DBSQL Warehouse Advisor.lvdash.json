This means that ALL cores were perfectly fully utilize during the entire execution\nRatio ~1 means that there is lots of paralleliszation (high tasks time per unit of time).\nRatio < 1 means that the exeuction time was not fully filled by task time across all cores. The smaller this number is, the more likely it is to be skewed. \nShould never really have a ratio > 1 (that would mean there were more total task time than cores could theoretically processs) when we KNOW the number of cores. \n-- Is the query getting the warehouse fully?\n-- Good ratio (is .5 reasonable?)\n-- Closer to zero is a problem (<0.05) -- only matters when queyies are large (filter num tasks / cores)\n\nNow since we do NOTE automatically know the number of cores, we have to make this ratio relative and create a PROXY metric. \nTo do that, we will take the average ratio of Total Task Time / Execution Time across the whole warehouse for ALL queries that had task time (exclude metadata operations)\nIdeal Ratio = 1 = ((Task Time)/ Cores ) / Execution Time\nSo Execution Time = Task Time / Cores\nSo Cores = Task Time / Execution Time in a perfect / avg scenario. \n\nThis is NOT perfect, but helps as a proxy for now.
